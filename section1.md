# Ethics and Reproducibility emphasis in this PhD and why it matters

The work I have carried out through this PhD so far, has had a very heavy focus on thinking about Ethics and Reproducibility as part of my research, not as a last minute add-on. This is because I truly believe it is of utmost importance there is a shift in how we proceed with science that currently works under a capitalistic world which advocates for mass production of positivist, fast research.

We are currently living in a period where many have started to talk about a "Reproducibility Crisis" [@baker2016500ScientistsLift], . In fact, the number of articles that appear in a Google Scholar search with those key words, from 2016 to now, goes to a total of 158 papers, versus just 36 papers mentioning these words in the title from 2000 to 2016, and no articles showing up as a result from 1900 to the 2000s. 


During my PhD work so far, one aspect of the research that has come with quite a lot of struggle is to find accurate parametrization of values for protein dynamics. This is a known issue for most of us who create computational models of biological systems. @wieber2020ModelsParameterizationSoftware call it an “epistemic opacity” when talking about lack of clarity in Computational Chemistry, where this opacity is entangled in methods and software alike. 

This of course leads to reproducibility issues, and as this unfolds, it becomes clear that the “untrustworthiness” of research is also an issue for many other researchers. In fact, a survey of 1576 scientists published in Nature [@baker2016500ScientistsLift] reported that over 70% of the participants failed to reproduce others’ experiments and over 50% failed to reproduce their own results. 

Interestingly, @tiwari2021ReproducibilitySystemsBiology, assessed the reproducibility of 455 mathematical models in systems biology and found that about 50% of published models were not reproducible either due to incorrect or missing information in the manuscript.

Making an effort into creating research that is reproducible can help to avoid wasting resources, including having to repeat the same experiment questions again and again because results from one study could not be reproduced or replicated by other groups. 

A big step into making sure other people can reproduce your work in the field of computer models is to share your code. However, stopping there is almost like doing nothing as the code needs to be well documented and embedded in environments if necessary to run the code with its required dependencies.
