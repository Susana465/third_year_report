# What work have I been involved with?

As this is a third year report, and not the final thesis, I have decided to focus it on the work that I have completed throughout the last year, which is very much revolves around ethics and reproducibility.

## What is my PhD research question?
Before we get into the work I have been doing, as some background, the biological question that started this PhD was how do CaMKII and NMDA receptors in the postsynaptic neuron interact and enable the processes of learning and memory?

When studying learning and memory at the molecular level, in health and disease, it has been shown that N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) and Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) together with their interactions with other proteins within neuronal spines, can influence their shape and size [@fink2002MolecularMechanismsCaMKII]. Long-term modifications of synaptic strength, such as LTD (Long Term Depression) and LTP (Long Term Potentiation) involve diverse chemical pathways and have been the primary mechanisms used to study the molecular basis of learning and memory [@blundon2008DissectingComponentsLongTerm]. So what exactly is happening at the cellular and molecular level during memory formation? 

These are the biological prompts that I look at when creating 3D models of the molecules in question. I use mainly [mcell](https://mcell.org/) and python to do so.

**TLDR: I create 3D models which simulate interactions between proteins important for understanding how memory works in animal brains.**

But as time went by, I realised more and more how important looking at the ethics of the research that we do is. How biased science actually is, and how we continue to carry these if we don't look at them in the face. Additionally, how much research time and money is wasted by doing experiments which cannot be reproduced or replicated later on. Hence my emphasis on these topics. 

I have made it a purpose of this PhD project to highlight and talk about some of the things I care most in research: making it transparent, inclusive, and accessible.

## Conferences: ICSB and COMBINE

So, now that is out of the way, let's begin where I left off last year: October 2022. At this time, I attended, together with one of my supervisors, Melanie Stefan, [COMBINE 2022](https://co.mbine.org/author/combine-2022/) satellite event and the International Conference on Systems Biology [(ICSB) conference](https://hi.converia.de/frontend/index.php?sub=93).

As these were very much about the topics I am involved with: Systems Biology and standards in Computational Modelling Biology.


### Data Hazards workshop:
I facilitated together with Melanie; we had 12 attendees in this workshop, and it was a great experience to interact with researchers interested in thinking about potential hazards the data they work with may carry.

Find GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/Susana465/Data_Hazards_workshops) which contains all the info used to carry it out, so anyone in the future could re-use what I have already done.

### Bias and reproducibility in a computational neurobiology PhD's journey:
Additionally, I also presented a poster at the main ICSB conference and was selected for a flash talk to showcase my work. I created this poster because I wanted to showcase, at a conference full of scientists at different stages of their research, how I take into account bias an reproducibility in my research.

## Open Life Sciences training:

Around the same time, I also started a sixteen week course to learn about *"openness, open science, open leadership, community interactions, value exchanges, inclusivity, accessibility, open Science practices in developing resources and training"*.

For this course, I applied with a project in mind. I wanted to discuss "Ethical standards and reproducibility of computer models in Neurobiology".

I wanted to use this course as an opportunity to see how I could further embed and include discussions about ethics and reproducibility in PhD with the idea in mind that other students or researchers in the future could draw inspiration from this work.

For this course, I was assigned a mentor who I would have chats with every two weeks, to discuss how I could move forward my project.

This project was the catalyst for a few things coming forward, as it taught me a lot more on how to use collaborative GitHub, version control, licencing my work and making spaces more accessible. The main highlights that came out of this project were:

- I organised a one-day symposium on data hazards, ethics and reproducibility (more on this [later](#collaborations)).

- I am now writing my thesis using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/), an open-source scientific and technical publishing system which enables me to create a working document which can include dynamic code, among many other great qualities. More on this also [later](./30-quarto_thesis.md).
