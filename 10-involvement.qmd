# What work have I been involved with?

## ICSB and COMBINE conferences

In October 2022, I attended, together with one of my supervisors, Melanie Stefan, [COMBINE 2022](https://co.mbine.org/author/combine-2022/) satellite event and the International Conference on Systems Biology [(ICSB) conference](https://hi.converia.de/frontend/index.php?sub=93).


### Data Hazards workshop:
I facilitated together with Melanie; we had 12 attendees in this workshop, and it was a great experience to interact with researchers interested in thinking about potential hazards the data they work with may carry.

Find GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/Susana465/Data_Hazards_workshops) which contains all the info used to carry it out, so anyone in the future could re-use what I have already done.

### Bias and reproducibility in a computational neurobiology PhD's journey:
Additionally, I also presented a poster at the main ICSB conference and was selected for a flash talk to showcase my work. I created this poster because I wanted to showcase, at a conference full of scientists at different stages of their research, how I take into account bias an reproducibility in my research.

## Open Life Sciences training:

Around the same time, I also started a sixteen week course to learn about *"openness, open science, open leadership, community interactions, value exchanges, inclusivity, accessibility, open Science practices in developing resources and training"*.

For this course, I applied with a project in mind. I wanted to discuss "Ethical standards and reproducibility of computer models in Neurobiology".

I wanted to use this course as an opportunity to see how I could further embed and include discussions about ethics and reproducibility in PhD with the idea in mind that other students or researchers in the future could draw inspiration from this work.

For this course, I was assigned a mentor who I would have chats with every two weeks, to discuss how I could move forward my project.

This project was the catalyst for a few things coming forward, as it taught me a lot more on how to use collaborative GitHub, version control, licencing my work and making spaces more accessible. The main highlights that came out of this project were:

- I organised a one-day symposium on data hazards, ethics and reproducibility (more on this [later](#collaborations)).

- I am now writing my thesis using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/), an open-source scientific and technical publishing system which enables me to create a working document which can include dynamic code, among many other great qualities.
