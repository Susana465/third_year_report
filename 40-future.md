# Looking back and forward:

Last year I wrote the following in the second year annual report: *"An aim of this thesis' project will be to write a case study, that being a chapter or more (or less), for the final thesis. This is part of creating a framework in which I can create more reproducible, accessible and ethical research. This work will be further developed during my time as an Enrichment Student at the Alan Turing Institute from October 2022 â€“ June 2023."*

I am very happy to report that I feel like I have very much accomplished this. Not only do I feel a lot more capable of creating work that is more accessible and reproducible, it can also be seen through the work that I have outputted during my [Enrichment Scheme](./20-enrichment.md).

Moreover, I have also managed to create dodecamer model of CaMKII (not publicly available).

## Goals for year ahead in relation to thesis:

Although I am not entirely sure yet how I will merge the work I have been doing with ethics and reproducibility into my thesis, this is something that I'd like to embed. For example, I think this PhD thesis could be used as a case study of someone who worked with computational models and created research that took into account ethics in the process and tried to make the work reproducible. To prove such efforts are possible and necessary. 

With that

## Rough plan for achieving these goals, identifying any areas that you believe could present challenges. If you are in second year or beyond, please give a rough plan for completing your thesis.

progress from last year said mrunning model on mcell would solve problem and it did and now running new versions of the model slowly building up.
