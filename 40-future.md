# Looking back and going forward:

Last year I wrote the following in the second year annual report: *"An aim of this thesis' project will be to write a case study, that being a chapter or more (or less), for the final thesis. This is part of creating a framework in which I can create more reproducible, accessible and ethical research. This work will be further developed during my time as an Enrichment Student at the Alan Turing Institute from October 2022 â€“ June 2023."*

I am very happy to report that I feel like I have very much accomplished this. Not only do I feel a lot more capable of creating work that is more accessible and reproducible, it can also be seen through the work that I have outputted during my as described in the [Enrichment Scheme chapter](./20-enrichment.md) of this report.

Moreover, I have also managed to create dodecamer model of CaMKII (not publicly available at the moment)! 

## Goals for year ahead in relation to thesis:

Although I am not entirely sure yet how I will merge the work I have been doing with ethics and reproducibility into my thesis, this is something that I'd like to embed. For example, I think this PhD thesis could be used as a case study of someone who worked with computational models and created research that took into account ethics in the process and tried to make the work reproducible. To prove such efforts are possible and necessary. 

With that in mind, continuing the development of the CaMKII model in a way that is reproducible is looking positive for the coming year. At the same time, putting an emphasis on the biological side of this research, looking into quantitative validation will be necessary (e.g. looking at time of CaMKII phosphorylation), as well as qualitative validation (i.e. how we know the CaMKII behaves, and whether behaviour can be replicated in the model). For this purpose, it will be useful to create a list and/or table listing all known phenomena that the model should replicate.
