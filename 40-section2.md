# Computer Modelling

In summary, some of the main reasons for using modelling are:

1.	Biological systems are complex and multiscale, models can help us to integrate experimental data, facilitating theoretical hypotheses, and addressing what if questions.

2.	Models aim to make clear the current state of knowledge regarding a particular system, by attempting to be precise about the elements involved and the interactions between them. Doing this can be an effective way to highlight gaps in understanding.

3.	Related to point one, models then serve to combine knowledge from different published research, and make biological predictions which can then serve as hypothesis to be tested empirically by experimentalists.

4.	Computer-simulated experiments can help guide the wet-lab process by narrowing the experimental search space, enabling more cost, time-effective and waste-free research, as well as more ethical research too as we reduce animal suffering through reduction of animal research.
