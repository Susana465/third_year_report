  abstract = {Computational chemistry grew in a new era of "desktop modeling", which coincided with a growing demand for modeling software, especially from the pharmaceutical industry. Parameterization of models in computational chemistry is an arduous enterprise, and we argue that this activity leads, in this specific context, to tensions among scientists regarding the lack of epistemic transparency of parameterized methods and the software implementing them. We relate one flame war from the Computational Chemistry mailing List in order to assess in detail the relationships between modeling methods, parameterization, software and the various forms of their enclosure or disclosure. Our claim is that parameterization issues are a source of epistemic opacity and that this opacity is entangled in methods and software alike. Models and software must be addressed together to understand the epistemological tensions at stake.},

  abstract = {Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) is thought to be a critical mediator of neuronal plasticity that links transiently triggered Ca(2+) signals to persistent changes in neuronal physiology. In one of its roles, CaMKII is an essential player in the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor-mediated increase in conductance at glutamatergic synapses, a process described as long-term potentiation, which serves as a common model for neuronal plasticity and memory. Recent studies have used genetic, biochemical, live cell imaging and mathematical modeling approaches to investigate neuronal CaMKII and have led to a model of the molecular steps of CaMKII translocation and activation that can explain its role in neuronal plasticity.},

  abstract = {The formation of memories relies in part on plastic changes at synapses between neurons. Although the mechanisms of synaptic plasticity have been studied extensively over several decades, many aspects of this process remain controversial. The cellular locus of expression of long-term potentiation (LTP), a major form of synaptic plasticity, is one of the most important unresolved phenomena. In this article, some recent advances in this area made possible by the development of new imaging tools are summarized. These studies have demonstrated that LTP is compound in nature and consists of both presynaptic and postsynaptic components. Some features of presynaptic and postsynaptic changes during compound LTP are also reviewed.},
