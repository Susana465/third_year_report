        "BioNetGen is a set of software tools which facilitate a rule-based approach to modelling biochemical reaction kinetics, where we can largely overcome the problem of combinatorial complexity that arises when modelling CaMKII. It has been calculated that CaMKII as a dodecamer can approximately have 10<sup>20</sup> possible states [@pharris2019MultistateModelCaMKII]; this, coupled with the potential of a full reaction network for each simulation (an added factor of combinatorial complexity), can render the model computationally intractable. BioNetGen can help us deal with this combinatorial complexity thanks to its rule-based modelling (RBM) \"don't care, don't write\" capabilities.\n",
        "\n",
        "BioNetGen language (BNGL) is a formal language which uses the BioNetGen software [@faeder2009Rulebased]. It allows for site-specific details of protein-protein interactions to be captured in models for the dynamics of these interactions in a systematic fashion, which also alleviates nomenclature and reusability issues. \n",
        "\n",
        "Hence, using this RBM approach is notable as it facilitates writing of multi-state modelling and can significantly, reduce the number of reactions that need to be written due to its “don’t write, don’t care” characteristic. Thereby dramatically improving the ability to model CaMKII as a dodecamer; I can make a model with multistate molecules, and specify the states of the reactants that are relevant for a particular reaction, and leave the rest unspecified. \n"

At every time step in an MCell simulation, each particle can move, collide with other particles or surfaces, and undergo bimolecular and unimolecular reactions.

        "I have constructed the models at different scales to validate CaMKII interactions with other molecules like calmodulin and NMDARs, at increasing levels of complexity. First I re-created a model of CaMKII as a monomer that was previously completed in 2017. The model created uses cBNGL and represents CaMKII as monomers to serve as a proof of concept as well as a starting validation point, as dynamics of this model were previously shown to be within biologically accurate limits. Secondly, I created a model of CaMKII as a hexamer since modelling this molecule as a dodecamer gave rise to a combinatorial explosion due to the high number of possible states and the network of interactions generated. This is currently in the works of being resolved as I run the model using the network-free simulation using MCell. We will then be able to model CaMKII as a dodecamer. Finally, I aim to validate this work against a model from Ordyan et al., 2020, where they successfully modelled CaMKII as a twelve subunit holoenzyme using BioNetGen simulations. \n",
        "\n",
        "As explained in the introduction of this report, CaMKII is a dodecameric molecule, meaning it’s composed of twelve subunits. Ideally, I would like to model CaMKII as a dodecamer since this would allow us to infer more accurately any emergent behaviour of the protein. However, due to combinatorial explosion, running a CaMKII as a dodecamer takes a really long time: 6+ hours without finalising run time, using a cBNG, SSA simulation. These simulations include only calcium binding to CaM, and CaM binding to CaMKII as a dodecamer, without further reactions added to avoid further complexity. The machine being used for these simulations is a x64-based laptop, with specs: 11th Gen Intel® Core™ i5-1145G7@2.60GHz, 1498Mhz, 4Core(s), 8 Logical Processors. SSA simulations generate a full network of reactions and causes the simulation to slow down considerably. At the moment, compartmental BNGL does not allow for NFsim simulations to be ran. This can be overcome by running the model with MCell as it provides a network free simulation capability. An alternative so far has also been to run the model with CaMKII as a hexamer. However, it still causes combinatorial explosion when generating network reactions. This should be resolved by running the model as a network free simulation in MCell.\n",
