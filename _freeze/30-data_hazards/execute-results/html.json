This is where a project like the [Data Hazards Project](https://datahazards.com/) comes in handy. Data Hazards is a project made to help us in thinking about worst-case scenarios and ways to mitigate these.\n\nThe Data Hazards Project has created a community-developed shared vocabulary of data science risks. The vocabulary presents data ethics concepts in the form of [Data Hazard Labels](https://datahazards.com/contents/data-hazards.html), similarly to chemical hazard labels. This project exists to facilitate material for interdisciplinary discussions and self-reflection about all kinds of data ethics risks. How do these labels look like and how can they be implemeted? Let's go through some examples to show how.\n\n## Example label: high environmental cost\n\n![\"High Environmental Impact\" Data Hazard Label](environment.png){#fig-environment width=\"150\"}\n\n### Description\n\nThis hazard is appropriate where methodologies are energy-hungry, data-hungry (requiring more and more computation), or require special hardware that require rare materials.\n\n### Examples\n\n-   Example: Running computer models in super computers requires vast energy usage.\n\n### Safety Precautions\n\n-   Consider in what circumstances it is worthwhile to use this type of methodology.\n    -   To communicate the scale of the issue to other stakeholders, you may want to [convert units of energy into more relatable units]().\n    -   Find out [if your cloud provider uses renewable energy]().\n    -   Consider profiling your code, and rewriting it to use less energy.\n-   Consider future work that would reduce the need to use increasingly more resources.\n\n## How to use the Data Hazards Project\n\nThere are four steps to using the Data Hazard labels:\n\n-   **Learning**: familiarising yourself with the Data Hazard labels.\n-   **Applying**: deciding which Hazard labels are relevant to your project.\n-   **Reflecting**: on what to do differently and what mitigations to make.\n-   **Display**: displaying the labels alongside your work can help you to communicate that you've thought about these broad ethical issues and how you'd like others to use your work.\n\nThis spells LARD 🧈, which makes it pretty easy to remember! It is however an unfortunate word it shortens to, as lard comes from dead pigs, so I like to manifest it's a plant-based LARD 🌱.\n\nAs part of a [Turing Way Book Dash](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/community-handbook/bookdash.html) hosted in May 2023, I worked together with a team to create a chapter on Data Hazards for the Turing Way Book. This chapter is still in [draft form](https://hackmd.io/ZoJpaBsnTBuAfwGWnMCwGg), as part of this experience we worked with an artist from Scriberia, to make an illustration of the Data Hazards application (@fig-DH_application).\n\n![Data Hazards Application Cycle [@community2023Illustrations].](DH_application.jpg){#fig-DH_application width=\"450\" fig-pos=\"h\"}\n\n## Application example into Research life-cycle\n\nTo help visualize where and when Data Hazards can be used in your workflow, below is an example assuming four main stages of workflow: design, data collection, data analysis and reporting. This is a generalised example, but something like this is what it looks like for me when I work on my PhD.\n\n### Design:\n\n-   Are you using data? Then doing some reflection on [identity and positionality](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/ethical-research/self-reflection/sr-positionality.html?highlight=bias) could help you think of what Data Hazards labels you might encounter as you design your project, for example [\"ranks of classifies people hazard\"](https://datahazards.com/contents/hazards/ranks-classifies.html) or [\"risk to privacy\"](https://datahazards.com/contents/hazards/risk-to-privacy.html) could apply at this stage.\n-   In this part of the workflow, you might want to prepare to avoid certain Data Hazards if you can, and if you can't avoid them because of where your data has come from, you may want to acknowledge this. For example, if you a [sensitive data project](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/project-design/sdp.html), what Data Hazard labels will apply, and/or what can you do to design your project in a way that avoids certain harms?\n\n### Data Collection and Analysis:\n\n-   As you are collecting and analyzing your data, you might want to iteratively think of the potential Data Hazards that exist in the information you are collecting. To then apply the labels as you perform the next step of the process: reporting.\n\n### Reporting:\n\n-   When reporting your results, you can think of applying and reporting the Data Hazard labels that are relevant for your project; examples of how I've done this can be found below in @tbl-datahazards-phd. Labeling your project with Data Hazards should also include considerations of mitigations to these risks. This would then be helpful for people who see your outputs in the future. They can be aware of potential risks as they proceed with the project, and continue to think of solutions to any issues related to the research topic.\n\n## Application into my PhD project: Presenting my PhD as a case study at AI UK conference\n\nIn order to showcase how Data Hazards can be reflected upon during a PhD, and taking the self-reflection described above into consideration, I have been implementing thinking about the vocabulary they provide into my own work. In line with this work, I made a poster that summarised aims of my PhD, for people to be able to say which labels they thought applied to my project. This poster was part of an exhibition stand with the Data Hazards Team, at [AI UK 2023](https://ai-uk.turing.ac.uk/programme/).When creating this poster (@fig-posterAIUK), I was able to both do some self-reflection and collaborative reflection, as described below.\n\n-   **Self-reflection (*what is my project and how will it be used?*):**\n\nWhen making the poster, this kind of self-reflection questions are useful for oneself to think about, but also for external people who are not involved with your project to understand what potential data hazards it might have. The final poster can be seen below in (@fig-posterAIUK). I followed the prompt questions available in the Data Hazards website for project owners who would like their projects to be discussed for data hazards:\n\n-- The overall objective of the project.\n\n-- Fairly detailed description of the variables in the dataset they are using (and what is not included).\n\n-- How and when the data was collected.\n\n-- Any statistical/algorithmic methods being used.\n\n-- Who has input on the project.\n\n-- What outputs are expected, and how these will be shared.\n\n-   **Collaborative reflection (*what data hazards may apply to my project?*):**\n\nDuring the poster presentation, people talked about the project, had a look at the poster, and decided by adding stickers to a list of hazards, to say which ones applied to it (@fig-DHCS_AIUK).\n\nAs can be seen in @fig-DHCS_AIUK (before end of the day), people were adding stickers to record which data hazard labels they thought applied to my PhD project. At the end of the day, I recorded final numbers and the results can be seen in the barchart below @fig-barchart.\n\n[![PhD Project decription - Case Study, to see GitHub repo, click on this figure.](poster_AIUK.png){#fig-posterAIUK fig-pos=\"t\"}](https://github.com/Susana465/DH_Project_CaseStudy)\n\n![Data Hazards Case Study Poster at AI UK](DHCS_AIUK.jpeg){#fig-DHCS_AIUK width=\"400\" fig-pos=\"t\"}\n\n### Results from collaborative reflections:\n\n-   **Difficult to understand Label was chosen the most** Interestingly, not all labels were chosen as applicable to my project (@fig-barchart). Only 6 of the 11 current labels were chosen as relevant, with \"difficult to understand\" being the most prevalent one, chosen by 6 people. High environmental impact and danger of misuse follow in closely with 5 people having chosen these ones. Of course these numbers are small and hold, more than anything, illustrative value as to how and why people may think certain labels apply to a project. In the case of my PhD project, which involves understanding of very specific molecules, as well as knowledge of programming and computer modelling software, it makes sense that the \"difficult to understand\" label was the one people chose the most.\n\n-   **find and explain mitigaions for these hardas. show examples of how im thinking to mitigate them.**\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=1}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![Data Hazards labels that may apply to my PhD.](30-data_hazards_files/figure-html/fig-barchart-output-1.png){#fig-barchart width=588 height=542 fig-pos='t'}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nMAKE A TABLE OF DATA HAZARDS -md or html or python?\n\n+----------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n|                                  | Data Hazard Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Safety Precautions                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n+==================================+========================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================+======================================================================================================================================================================================================================================+\n| ![](difficult-to-understand.png) | **Difficult to understand.** There is a danger that the technology is difficult to understand.

I organised and facilitated two Data Hazards workshops during my third PhD year:\n\n### Workshop at COMBINE conference (Berlin, October 2022)\n\nThe [COMBINE (Computational Modeling in Biology) conference](https://reproduciblebiomodels.org/combine-2022/) was an in person event, where I proposed, ran and co-facilitated a Data Hazards workshop with my supervisor Melanie Stefan. Melanie presented a project study for the participants to then think what potential Data Hazard labels applied to it. We had 12 participants, who discussed and labelled the project during the workshop.\n\nTopics of interest at COMBINE included discussion of data exchange, pipelines and discussing standardizing methods for computer modelling of systems biology. Data Hazards have the potential to become a standard practice for modelling systems biology research. This session wowasa good opportunity to discuss how to make Data Hazards assessments a standard part of the information shared with computational models. The materials used for this workshop can be found in this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Susana465/Data_Hazards_workshops).\n\nThe workshops I have ran have had the following types of roles:\n\n**Facilitators:**\n\n-- There to run the workshop and help everyone get the most out of it.\n\n-- This involves managing each of the breakout rooms and supporting the discussions.\n\n**Project Owners:**\n\n-- There to have their project discussed by the audience members.\n\n-- They are seeking feedback, with a focus on Data Hazards, on an idea or project.\n\n**Audience Members:**\n\n-- There to find out more about the projects and provide feedback.\n\n-- Combination of different types of people.\n\n-- Can be 'experts' on topic being presented by project owners or not (both can be interesting!).\n\n### Data Hazards, Ethics and Reproducibility Symposium (London, March 2023)\n\nTogether with Ceilidh Welsh, we co-organised a hybrid, one day symposium at the Alan Turing Institute (ATI) HQ in London: [Data Hazards, Ethics and Reproducibility Symposium](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/in-person-data-hazards-ethics-and-reproducibility-one-day-symposium-tickets-516803953537). This was possible thanks to the Enrichment scheme we were part of, and thanks to the grassroots funding we were granted by the ATI.\n\nThe event encouraged attendees to explore, discuss and reflect on the ethical implications and wider societal impact of specific data-intensive projects. It was an opportunity for attendees to appreciate that ethics is complex, situational and important to discuss in our own contexts. It aimed to shine a light on an event that promotes data ethics through the content of the event, and also its planning and delivery.\n\nWe are in the process of creating a chapter in the Turing Way Book to publish our experience organising an accesible event which aimed to discuss how people in different stages of their careers can embed thinking about ethics, reproducibility and data hazards as they go, not as an add-on at the end.\n\nBelow you can find a table with the day's programme (@tbl-der-programme), and [here](https://hackmd.io/@LdFsvYwFRxKsUEYo35m4VA/Bkf05TdS2#DERR-Symposium-and-Data-Hazards-Workshop-Case-Study) you can find a draft for of the behind the scenes of how we organised and our reflections on making this event happen.\n\n+---------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| Time (GMT)    | Topic                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n+===============+==============================================================================================================================================================================================================================+\n| 10:00 - 10:15 | Welcome and Introduction to the day                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n+---------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| 10:15 - 11:05 | **Keynote Speakers:**                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n|               |                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n|               | -   Anne Lee Steele - Talk title: [`From culture to computation: mapping my open research journey.`](https://github.com/Susana465/der_symposium_20230310/blob/main/culture_to_computation_ALS.pdf)                           |\n|               |                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n|               | -   Paz Bernaldo - Talk title: [`Am I in or am I out?
