The ethical implications that ought to be considered go beyond most ethics Institutional Review Boards, to questions about the wider societal impact of data science and algorithms work. This is where a project like the [Data Hazards Project](https://datahazards.com/) comes in handy. Data Hazards is a project made to help us in thinking about worst-case scenarios and ways to mitigate these. \n\nThe Data Hazards Project has created a community-developed shared vocabulary of data science risks. The vocabulary presents data ethics concepts in the form of [Data Hazard Labels](https://datahazards.com/contents/data-hazards.html), similarly to chemical hazard labels. This project exists to facilitate material for interdisciplinary discussions and self-reflection about all kinds of data ethics risks.\n\n## Example label: high environmental cost\n\n<center><img src=\"https://datahazards.com/_images/environment.png\"  width=\"200\" height=\"\"></center>\n\n### Description\n\nThis hazard is appropriate where methodologies are energy-hungry, data-hungry (requiring more and more computation), or require special hardware that require rare materials.\n\n### Examples\n\n - Example 1: Running computer models in super computers requires vast energy usage.\n\n### Safety Precautions\n - Consider in what circumstances it is worthwhile to use this type of methodology.\n   - To communicate the scale of the issue to other stakeholders, you may want to [convert units of energy into more relatable units]().\n   - Find out [if your cloud provider uses renewable energy]().\n   - Consider profiling your code, and rewriting it to use less energy.\n   \n- Consider future work that would reduce the need to use increasingly more resources.\n\n## Application example into Research life-cycle\nTo help visualize where and when Data Hazards can be used in your workflow, below is an example assuming four main stages of workflow: design, data collection, data analysis and reporting. This is a generalised example, but something like this is what it looks like for me when I work on my PhD. \n\n\n### Design:\n - Are you using data? Then doing some reflection on [identity and positionality](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/ethical-research/self-reflection/sr-positionality.html?highlight=bias) could help you think of what Data Hazards labels you might encounter as you design your project, for example [\"ranks of classifies people hazard\"](https://datahazards.com/contents/hazards/ranks-classifies.html) or [\"risk to privacy\"](https://datahazards.com/contents/hazards/risk-to-privacy.html) could apply at this stage.\n - In this part of the workflow, you might want to prepare to avoid certain Data Hazards if you can, and if you can't avoid them because of where your data has come from, you may want to acknowledge this. For example, if you a [sensitive data project](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/project-design/sdp.html), what Data Hazard labels will apply, and/or what can you do to design your project in a way that avoids certain harms?\n \n### Data Collection and Analysis:\n - As you are collecting and analyzing your data, you might want to iteratively think of the potential Data Hazards that exist in the information you are collecting. To then apply the labels as you perform the next step of the process: reporting.\n\n### Reporting:\n - When reporting your results, you can think of applying and reporting the Data Hazard labels that are relevant for your project; examples of how others have done this can be found here [link to self reflection and case studie(s)]. Labeling your project with Data Hazards should also include considerations of mitigations to these risks. This would then be helpful for people who see your outputs in the future. They can be aware of potential risks as they proceed with the project, and continue to think of solutions to any issues related to the research topic.\n\n## Application of Data Hazards into my PhD project:\nIn order to showcase how Data Hazards can be reflected upon during a PhD, I have been implementing thinking about the vocabulary they provide into my own work. In line with this work, I made a poster that summarised aims of my PhD, for people to be able to say which labels they thought applied to my project. This poster was part of an exhibition stand with the Data Hazards Team, at [AI UK 2023](https://ai-uk.turing.ac.uk/programme/).\n\n### Presenting my PhD as a case study at AI UK conference:\n\nWhen creating the poster below, I followed the prompt questions available in the Data Hazards website for project owners who would like their projects to be discussed for data hazards, they are as below:\n\n- The overall objective of the project\n- Fairly detailed description of the variables in the dataset they are using (and what is not included)\n- How and when the data was collected\n- Any statistical/algorithmic methods being used\n- Who has input on the project\n- What outputs are expected, and how these will be shared\n\nThis kind of self-reflection questions are useful for oneself to think about, but also for external people who are not involved with your project to understand what potential data hazards it might have.\n\nDuring the poster presentation, people would come over and talk about the project, have a look at the poster, and decide by adding stickers to a list of hazards, to say which ones applied to it. You can see below how it looked (@fig-DHCS_AIUK): \n\n![Data Hazards Case Study Poster at AI UK](DHCS_AIUK.jpeg){#fig-DHCS_AIUK}\n\nYou can also find a view of the poster in the GitHub repo where it lives, by clicking the image below:\n\n[![Data Hazards Project - Case Study][a]][b]\n\n[a]: poster_AIUK.png\n\n[b]: https://github.com/Susana465/DH_Project_CaseStudy/blob/main/20230314_DH_casestudy.pdf\n\nSo, as can be seen in @fig-DHCS_AIUK (before end of the day), people chose which data hazard labels applied to my PhD project. At the end of the day, I recorded final numbers and the results can be seen below @fig-barchart. \n\nI have left the code which runs the bar chart below, so you can get a glimpse into how a Quarto book can work and embed runnning some python code and output results directly, all in one place. \n\n::: {.cell execution_count=1}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# The dataset:\ndata = {'Reinforces existing biases':4, 'High environmental impact':5,\n        'Lacks community involvement':4, 'Danger of misuse':5, 'Difficult to understand':6,\n        'May cause direct harm':1, 'Lacks informed consent':4}\ncourses = list(data.keys())\nvalues = list(data.values())\n  \nfig = plt.figure(figsize = (19, 5))\n \n# Creating the bar plot\nplt.bar(courses, values, color ='tab:red',\n        width = 0.4)\n \nplt.xlabel(\"Data Hazard Labels\")\nplt.ylabel(\"No. of times label was chosen as relevant for my PhD project\")\nplt.title(\"Data Hazards labels that may apply to my PhD\")\nplt.show()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![Data Hazards labels that may apply to my PhD](30-data_hazards_files/figure-pdf/fig-barchart-output-1.pdf){#fig-barchart fig-pos='H'}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nInterestingly, \nTALK ABOUT RESULTS OBTAINED.

I created this poster because I wanted to showcase, at a conference full of scientists at different stages of their research, how I take into account bias an reproducibility in my research.\n\nAs a preview, you can see it below, please click on it if you'd like to view a bigger version of this image. \n\nFind GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/Susana465/Bias-and-Reproducibility-Poster).\n\n[![Poster about bias and reproducibility, showing research cycle as a journey which starts with design, then data collection, data analysis and final reporting, and compares this through images to growing an apple tree, collecting the apples and then selling them.][1]][2]\n\n[1]: ./20221006_poster_phd_journey.jpg\n\n[2]: https://github.com/Susana465/Bias-and-Reproducibility-Poster/blob/main/20221006_poster_phd_journey.jpg\n\n\n\n{{< pagebreak >}}\n\n",
