It has been calculated that CaMKII as a dodecamer can approximately have 10^20^ possible states [@pharris2019MultistateModelCaMKII]; this, together with the potential of a full reaction network for each simulation (an added factor of combinatorial complexity), can render the model computationally intractable. BioNetGen can help us deal with this combinatorial complexity thanks to its rule-based modelling (RBM) \"don't care, don't write\" capabilities. And as we will see later MCell can help with modelling network-free simulations.\n\nBioNetGen language (BNGL) is a formal language which uses the BioNetGen software [@faeder2009Rulebased]. It allows for site-specific details of protein-protein interactions to be captured in models for the dynamics of these interactions in a systematic fashion, which also alleviates nomenclature and reusability issues. \n\nHence, using this RBM approach is notable as it facilitates writing of multi-state modelling and can significantly, reduce the number of reactions that need to be written due to its “don’t write, don’t care” characteristic. Thereby dramatically improving the ability to model CaMKII as a dodecamer; I can make a model with multistate molecules, and specify the states of the reactants that are relevant for a particular reaction, and leave the rest unspecified (see @fig-bngl-abc-model)\n\n::: {#fig-bngl-abc-model .cell execution_count=1}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nbegin model\n\nbegin parameters\n# Define initial number of molecules released\n  A_i 150\n  B_i 150\n  C_i 100\n\n#Define reaction rates\n  kon 1e-2\n  koff 1e-3\n  k_P 1e1\nend parameters\n\nbegin molecule types\n# Here we define the molecules and the possible states and\nbinding sites they can have\n# Molecule A has a binding site (a), and a Phosphorylation\nsite which can be unphosphorylated (~0) or phosphorylated\n(~P):\n    A(a,T286~0~P)\n# Molecule B has a binding site (b):\n    B(b)\n# Molecule C has no binding sites:\n    C()\nend molecule types\n\n\nbegin species\n# Molecule A starts with binding site a free, and with\nphosphorylation site unphosphorylated\n    A(a,T286~0) A_i\n# Molecule B starts with binding site b free\n    B(b) B_i\n# Molecule C has no binding sites so it starts as it is\n    C() C_i\nend species\n\n\nbegin reaction rules\n# A_free and B_free can resversbly bind to give AB_complex\n# Don't need to specify, if I'm not interested, status of\nphosphorylation for molecule A.

See screenshot from notebook in @fig-ode_bngl below.\n\n![What an ODE output from the model above looks like, shown as output is created in jupyter notebook.](ode_bngl.PNG){#fig-ode_bngl} \n\n### MCell (Monte Carlo Cell) and how it simulates reactions in 3D\nMCell is a biochemistry simulation tool that uses spatially realistic 3D cellular models and stochastic Monte Carlo algorithms to simulate the movements and interactions of discrete molecules within and between cells, [@bartol2000Monte], [@kerr2008FAST], [@bartol2015Computational]. MCell is a particle-based simulator that represents molecules as point particles in 3D space. At every time step in an MCell simulation, each particle can move, collide with other particles or surfaces, and undergo bimolecular and unimolecular reactions. The basic elements of a simulation step are as seen in @fig-mcell_comp taken from @gupta2018Spatial.\n\n![MCell Components. (A) Volume Molecules diffusing in free space. (B) Mesh Object defined by a Plane with Surface Molecules diffusing on it. (C) Mesh Object defined by a complex closed mesh with multiple defined Surface  Regions, in which Surface Molecules have different diffusion constants, as defined by corresponding Surface Classes.](mcell_comp.png){#fig-mcell_comp} \n\nBriefly, MCell operates as follows: as a volume molecule diffuses, all molecules within a given radius along its trajectory, or at the point of collision on a surface, are considered for a reaction. For surface molecules (in membranes), the molecule first diffuses, and then its neighbours are evaluated for reaction. \n\nThere is no volume exclusion for molecules diffusing in 3D volumes, and molecules on surfaces occupy a  fixed area. MCell allows defining arbitrary geometry @fig-mcell_comp (C), and complex models such as a 180μm3 3DEM reconstruction of hippocampal neuropil have been used to construct a geometrically-precise simulation of 100s of neuronal synapses at once [@bartol2015Computational]. A detailed description of mathematical foundations of MCell’s algorithms can be found here: @bartol2000Monte, @kerr2008FAST, @bartol2015Computational.\n\nMCell4, version used for this project, provides a versatile Python interface, which is very useful for writing models with said interface and running mcell models this way.  MCell4 provides two different user experiences, one through its visual interface as an add-on in Blender 2.93, known as CellBlender (see back at @fig-cellblender), the other user experience one through a new Python interface. This provides users with the flexibility to change between both experiences, or to run the simulations using Python and visualize the simulations in Blender (@fig-python-bngl-cellblender). \n\n![Diagram of what workflow of this project can look like, it is not exhaustive of all the ways in which these software can interact.

First I re-created a model of CaMKII as a monomer that was previously completed in 2017. The model created uses cBNGL and represents CaMKII as monomers to serve as a proof of concept as well as a starting validation point, as dynamics of this model were previously shown to be within biologically accurate limits. Secondly, I created a model of CaMKII as a hexamer since modelling this molecule as a dodecamer gave rise to a combinatorial explosion due to the high number of possible states and the network of interactions generated. This was them resolved as I run the model using the network-free simulation capabalities using MCell. This has then resulted in being able to create a (still in the workd) model of CaMKII as a dodecamer.  These simulations include only calcium binding to CaM, and CaM binding to CaMKII as a dodecamer, without further reactions added to avoid further complexity. Finally, I aim to validate this work against a model from Ordyan et al., 2020, where they successfully modelled CaMKII as a twelve subunit holoenzyme using BioNetGen simulations. \n \n### Model of CaMKII as a dodecamer\nFor brevity's sake, I have chosen to not go into details of CaMKII, as that was discussed in depth in the pasy 2 yearly reports. CaMKII is a dodecameric molecule, meaning it’s composed of twelve subunits. Modelling it as a dodecamer  allow us to infer more accurately any emergent behaviour of the protein.\n\n## Model development and validation\nFollowing from what I did last year, show results, copy what's on github https://github.com/Susana465/CaMKII_hexa_bgnl_to_mcell\n\nDevelop the description of how the models work – model description and results. Biologist friendly description of the model. \n\ntalk about roustness, generalisable, environments\n\nWrite abstract for each chapter, then merge them altogether.  \n\n### A reproducible model\n\nThe same processes used in software development can also be applied to biological model development. Therefore, when developing the models in this project, four main points were considered throughout, as suggested by @husar2022MCell4:\n\n1.\tCreate incremental development where the model is built step by step, relying on solid foundations of modelling done and validated before, \n\n2.\tCreate a modularity that provides the capability to create self-contained, reusable libraries,\n\n3.\tPerform unit testing and validation to verify that parts of the model behave as expected and,\n\n4.\tCreate human-readable and writable model code that can be stored using git or other code version control software which also allows code reviews so that other team members can inspect the latest changes to the model.\n\n",
